(Whispered) Yeah!

We had a flyin' guitar man
Maybe the fastest in the land
But he was goin' no where fast
Speed ain't nothing without class

He couldn't play tasty (Oh, No)
Tasty like this (Man, Yeah) (guitar solo)
Tasty, Tasty - Ain't it time we mellow out

We had a man named crazy Ott
He overplayed his bass a lot
We hadda kick him in the pants
His fingers moved like vitus dance

He couldn't play tasty (Oh, No)
Tasty like this (Man, Yeah) (bass solo)
Tasty, Tasty - Ain't it time we mellow out

We had a drummer named Joe
He played so fast we let him go
He ran away with all our songs
Now he's school where he belongs

He couldn't play tasty (Oh, No)
Tasty like this (Man, Yeah) (drum solo)
Tasty, Tasty - Ain't it time we mellow out

We got some tasty harmony
Sometimes there's two sometimes there's three
We like to sing it now and then
Mostly we save it 'till the end

We gonna sing tasty (Oh, Yeah)
Tasty like this - now (acapella voices)

Badadadadadadapapadpow
Tasty, Ooh Tasty
Ain't it time we mellow out

We like to play that Rock and Roll,
Man it's the only way to go
A Drummer, Bass and two Guitars
When you're playin' tasty you'll go far

We gonna play Tasty (Oh, Yeah)
Tasty rock and roll - Alright!

Tasty, Tasty - Ain't it time we mellow out

We gonna do Tasty (Oh yeah) - Tasty like this (Man, Yeah)
(Guitar, Bas and Drum solos in succession)

Tasty, ooh Tasty - Ain't it time we mellow out!
