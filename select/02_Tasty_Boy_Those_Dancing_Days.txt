You are hot skim milk in my throat
Just like cinnamon chai, tasty boy
Your finger touch, marvellous marshmallows
You are crispy like a cheese doodle

You taste like cloudberry ice cream
Soft and smooth
To kiss your skin tastes like salty shrimps
On my seven eleven night sandwich
My favourite flavour hoe, pasta with pesto
You remind me of bananananananana split

Squeeze, squeeze
Squeeze, squeeze
Squeeze an orange in to juice
Squeeze... me... in to juice
