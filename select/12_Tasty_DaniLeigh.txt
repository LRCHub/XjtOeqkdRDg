I got you coming first
Like this shit is a race
I give you all of my time
And spend it on your waist
Sweet as creme brulee
Eat it till it's sorbet
Shit aint minute maid
You should let it marinate
Put it on my plate
That's ya dinner date
I'm gon grab your face
In between these legs
It's tasty, it's tasty
It's tasty, it's tasty
Dripping down your thigh
That's my favourite mess (mess, mess)
That's my shit, that's my shit
Love it how I ride
I'm your favourite
Savor it, savor it
(Cause) I'm tasty, I'm tasty
I'm tasty, I'm tasty
Don't keep me waiting long
Been waiting here all day
If I give you all of my time
Don't put that shit to waste (waste)
Sweet as creme brulee
Eat it till it's sorbet
Shit aint minute maid
You should let it marinate
Put it on my plate
That's ya dinner date
I'm gon grab your face
In between these legs
It's tasty, it's tasty
It's tasty, it's tasty
Dripping down your thigh
That's my favourite mess (mess, mess)
That's my shit, that's my shit
Love it how I ride
I'm your favourite
Savor it, savor it
(Cause) I'm tasty, I'm tasty
I'm tasty, I'm tasty
